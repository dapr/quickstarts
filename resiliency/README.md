# Dapr Resiliency

In this Quickstart, you will observe Dapr resiliency capabilities by simulating a system failure. You have the option of using the service invocation quickstarts to demonstrate Dapr resiliency between service-to-service communication, or the state management quickstart to demonstrate resiliency between apps and components.
