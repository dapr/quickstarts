     * Reminders are a mechanism to trigger persistent callbacks on an actor at specified times.
     * Their functionality is similar to timers. But unlike timers, reminders are triggered under
     * all circumstances until the actor explicitly unregisters them or the actor is explicitly
     * deleted. Specifically, reminders are triggered across actor deactivations and failovers
     * because the Actors runtime persists information about the actor's reminders using actor
     * state provider. Also existing reminders can be updated by calling this registration method
     * again using the same reminderName.
