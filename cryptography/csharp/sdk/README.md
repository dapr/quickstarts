# Dapr cryptography

In this quickstart, you'll create a service that demonstrates how the Cryptography API can be readily utilized in a .NET application.
Our application will perform two operations using an RSA asymmetric key:
- Encrypt and decrypt an in-memory string value
- Encrypt and decrypt a file as a stream

Visit [this link](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/cryptography/cryptography-overview/) for more information about the Dapr Cryptography API.

## Generating the key
This sample requires a private RSA key to be generated and placed in the `/keys` directory within the project.
While a key has been generated and distributed with this sample, the following command can be used to generate
your own key if you have OpenSSL installed on your machine:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -out keys/rsa-private-key.pem
```

> **WARNING: This RSA key is included in this project strictly for demonstration and testing purposes.**
> - Do **NOT** use this key in any production environment or for any real-world applications.
> - This key is publicly available and should be considered compromised.
> - Generating and using your own secure keys is essential for maintaining security in your projects.

## Run the quickstart
1. Open a new terminal window. Change the directory to that of the `cryptography` .NET project, then launch Dapr and 
2. the service with the following command:

<!-- STEP
name: Run crypto service
expected-stdout_lines:
  - 'Starting Dapr with id crypto. HTTP Port:'
  - '== APP ==       Encrypting string with key rsa-private-key.pem with plaintext value ''P@assw0rd'''
  - '== APP ==       Decrypted string with key rsa-private-key.pem with plaintext value ''P@assw0rd'''
  - '== APP ==       Encrypted string from plaintext value ''P@assw0rd'' and decrypted to ''P@assw0rd'''
  - '== APP ==       Encrypted file '
  - '== APP ==       Decrypting in-memory bytes to file '
  - '== APP ==       and the validation check returns ''True'
output_match_mode: substring
match_order: none
background: true
sleep: 15
timeout_seconds: 60
-->

```bash
dapr run --app-id crypto --resources-path "../../../components/" -- dotnet run
```

The terminal console should show standard Dapr startup logs, and then start your application showing the
output similar to the following:

```text

You're up and running! Both Dapr and your app logs will appear here.
