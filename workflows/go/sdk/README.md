# Dapr workflows

In this quickstart, you'll create a simple console application to demonstrate Dapr's workflow programming model and the workflow authoring client. The console app 
starts and manages an order processing workflow.
The workflow management API provided by the Dapr client can also be used interchangeably with minor adjustments

This quickstart includes one project:

- Go app `order-processor` 

The quickstart contains 1 workflow (OrderProcessingWorkflow) which simulates purchasing items from a store, and 5 unique activities within the workflow. These 5 
activities are as follows:

- NotifyActivity: This activity utilizes a logger to print out messages throughout the workflow. These messages notify the user when there is insufficient 
Â§inventory, their payment couldn't be processed, and more.
- ProcessPaymentActivity: This activity is responsible for processing and authorizing the payment.
- VerifyInventoryActivity: This activity checks the state store to ensure that there is enough inventory present for purchase.
- UpdateInventoryActivity: This activity removes the requested items from the state store and updates the store with the new remaining inventory value.
- RequestApprovalActivity: This activity seeks approval from Manager, if payment is greater than 50000 USD.

### Run the order processor workflow

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to `order-processor` directory.
2. Run the console app with Dapr: 
<!-- STEP
name: Running this example
expected_stdout_lines:
  - "for 10 cars - $150000"
  - "There are 100 cars available for purchase"
  - "Requesting approval for payment of 150000USD for 10 cars"
  - "has been approved!"
  - "There are now 90 cars left in stock"
  - "Workflow completed - result: COMPLETED"
output_match_mode: substring
background: true
timeout_seconds: 120
sleep: 30
-->

```sh

dapr run -f .
```

3. Expected output

```

4. Stop Dapr workflow with CTRL-C or:
<!-- END_STEP -->

```sh
dapr stop -f .
```



### View workflow output with Zipkin

For a more detailed view of the workflow activities (duration, progress etc.), try using Zipkin.

1. View Traces in Zipkin UI - In your browser go to http://localhost:9411 to view the workflow trace spans in the Zipkin web UI. The order-processor workflow 
should be viewable with the following output in the Zipkin web UI. Note: the [openzipkin/zipkin](https://hub.docker.com/r/openzipkin/zipkin/) docker container is 
launched on running `dapr init`.

### What happened? 

When you ran the above comands:

1. First the "user" inputs an order for 10 cars into the concole app.
2. A unique order ID for the workflow is generated (in the above example, `b903d749cd814e099f06ebf4a56a2f90`) and the workflow is scheduled.
3. The `NotifyActivity` workflow activity sends a notification saying an order for 10 cars has been received.
4. The `VerifyInventoryActivity` workflow activity checks the inventory data, determines if you can supply the ordered item, and responds with the number of cars 
in stock.
5. The `RequestApprovalActivity` workflow activity is triggered due to buisness logic for orders exceeding $50k and user is prompted to manually approve the 
purchase before continuing the order. 
6. The workflow starts and notifies you of its status.
7. The `ProcessPaymentActivity` workflow activity begins processing payment for order `b903d749cd814e099f06ebf4a56a2f90` and confirms if successful.
8. The `UpdateInventoryActivity` workflow activity updates the inventory with the current available cars after the order has been processed.
9. The `NotifyActivity` workflow activity sends a notification saying that order `b903d749cd814e099f06ebf4a56a2f90` has completed.
10. The workflow terminates as completed.
