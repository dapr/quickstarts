# Dapr Bindings

In this quickstart, you'll create two microservices, one with an input binding and another with an output binding. You'll bind to Kafka, but note that there are a myriad of components that Dapr can bind to ([see Dapr components](https://github.com/dapr/docs/tree/master/concepts/bindings)). 

This quickstart includes two microservices:
- Node.js microservice that utilizes an input binding
- Python microservice that utilizes an output binding

The bindings connect to Kafka, allowing us to push messages into a Kafka instance (from the Python microservice) and receive message from that instance (from the Node microservice) without having to know where the instance is hosted. Instead, connect through the sidecars using the Dapr API. See architecture diagram to see how the components interconnect locally:

Dapr allows us to deploy the same microservices from the local machines to Kubernetes. Correspondingly, this quickstart has instructions for deploying this project [locally](#Run-Locally) or in [Kubernetes](#Run-in-Kubernetes).

## Prerequisites

### Prerequisites to Run Locally

- [Dapr CLI with Dapr initialized](https://github.com/dapr/docs/tree/master/getting-started)
- [Node.js version 8 or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Python 3.4 or greater](https://www.python.org/)

### Prerequisites to Run in Kubernetes

- [Dapr enabled Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/getting-started/environment-setup.md#installing-dapr-on-a-kubernetes-cluster)

## Run Locally

### Clone the quickstarts repository
Clone this quickstarts repository to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone [-b <dapr_version_tag>] https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts.git
```

>**Note**: See https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts#supported-dapr-runtime-version for supported tags. Use `git clone https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts.git` when using the edge version of dapr runtime.

### Run Kafka Docker Container Locally

In order to run the Kafka bindings quickstart locally, you will run the [Kafka broker server](https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker) in a docker container on your machine.

1. To run the container locally, run:
    ```bash
      docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-single-kafka.yml up -d
    ```
2. To see the container running locally, run:
    ```bash
      docker ps
    ```

    The output should be similar to this:

    ```bash
      342d3522ca14        kafka-docker_kafka                      "start-kafka.sh"         14 hours ago        Up About
      a minute   0.0.0.0:9092->9092/tcp                               kafka-docker_kafka_1
      0cd69dbe5e65        wurstmeister/zookeeper                  "/bin/sh -c '/usr/sbâ€¦"   8 days ago          Up About
      a minute   22/tcp, 2888/tcp, 3888/tcp, 0.0.0.0:2181->2181/tcp   kafka-docker_zookeeper_1
    ```

### Run Node Microservice with Input Binding

Now that you have Kafka running locally on your machine, you'll need to run the microservices. You'll start by running the Node microservice that uses input bindings:

1. Navigate to Node subscriber directory in your CLI: 
    ```bash
      cd nodeapp
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
      npm install
    ```
3. Run Node quickstart app with Dapr: 
    ```bash
      dapr run --app-id bindings-nodeapp --app-port 3000 node app.js --components-path ./components
    ```

### Run Python Microservice with Output Binding

Next, run the Python microservice that uses output bindings

1. Open a new CLI window and navigate to Python subscriber directory in your CLI: 
    ```bash
      cd pythonapp
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
      pip3 install requests
    ```
3. Run Python quickstart app with Dapr: 
    ```bash
      dapr run --app-id bindings-pythonapp python3 app.py --components-path ./components
    ```

### Observe Logs

1. Observe the Python logs, which show a successful output binding with Kafka:

    ```bash
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == {'data': {'orderId': 1}}
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == <Response [200]>
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == {'data': {'orderId': 2}}
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == <Response [200]>
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == {'data': {'orderId': 3}}
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == <Response [200]>
    ```

2. Observe the Node logs, which show a successful input binding with Kafka: 

    ```bash
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == { orderId: 1 }
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == Hello from Kafka!
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == { orderId: 2 }
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == Hello from Kafka!
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == { orderId: 3 }
      [0m?[94;1m== APP == Hello from Kafka!
    ```

### Cleanup

Once you're done, you can spin down your local Kafka Docker Container by running:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-single-kafka.yml down
```

## Run in Kubernetes

### Setting up a Kafka in Kubernetes

1. Install Kafka via [incubator/kafka helm chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/incubator/kafka)
    ```bash
      helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
      helm repo update
      kubectl create ns kafka
      helm install dapr-kafka incubator/kafka --namespace kafka -f ./kafka-non-persistence.yaml
    ```

2. Wait until kafka pods are running
    ```bash
      kubectl -n kafka get pods -w
    ```

    ```bash
      NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
      dapr-kafka-0             1/1     Running   0          2m7s
      dapr-kafka-zookeeper-0   1/1     Running   0          2m57s
      dapr-kafka-zookeeper-1   1/1     Running   0          2m13s
      dapr-kafka-zookeeper-2   1/1     Running   0          109s
    ```


### Deploy Assets

Now that the Kafka binding is set up, deploy the assets.

1. In your CLI window, navigate to the deploy directory
2. Run `kubectl apply -f .` which will deploy bindings-nodeapp and bindings-pythonapp microservices. It will also apply the Kafka bindings component configuration you set up in the last step.
3. Run `kubectl get pods -w` to see each pod being provisioned.


### Observe Logs

1. Observe the Python app logs, which show a successful output binding with Kafka:
    ```bash
      kubectl get pods
    ```
    The output should look like this:

    ```bash
      NAME                                    READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
      bindings-nodeapp-699489b8b6-mqhrj       2/2     Running       0          4s
      bindings-pythonapp-644489969b-c8lg5     2/2     Running       0          4m9s
      dapr-operator-86cddcfcb7-v2zjp          1/1     Running       0          6h6m
      dapr-placement-5d6465f8d5-pz2qt         1/1     Running       0          6h6m
      dapr-sidecar-injector-dc489d7bc-k2h4q   1/1     Running       0          6h6m
    ```

    Look for the name of the `binding-pythonapp` pod and run:
    ```bash
      kubectl logs bindings-pythonapp-644489969b-c8lg5 python
    ```

    ```bash
      ...
      {'data': {'orderId': 240}}
      <Response [200]>
      {'data': {'orderId': 241}}
      <Response [200]>
      ...
    ```

2. Observe the Node app logs, which show a successful input bining with Kafka: 

    ```bash
      kubectl get pods
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    ```bash
      NAME                                    READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
      bindings-nodeapp-699489b8b6-mqhrj       2/2     Running       0          4s
      bindings-pythonapp-644489969b-c8lg5     2/2     Running       0          4m9s
      dapr-operator-86cddcfcb7-v2zjp          1/1     Running       0          6h6m
      dapr-placement-5d6465f8d5-pz2qt         1/1     Running       0          6h6m
      dapr-sidecar-injector-dc489d7bc-k2h4q   1/1     Running       0          6h6m
    ```

    Look for the name of `binding-nodeapp` pod and run:

    ```bash
      kubectl logs bindings-nodeapp-699489b8b6-mqhrj node
    ```

    The output should look like this:

    ```bash
      Node App listening on port 3000!
      ...
      Hello from Kafka!
      { orderId: 240 }
      Hello from Kafka!
      { orderId: 241 }
      ...
    ```

### Cleanup

Once you're done, you can spin down your Kubernetes resources by navigating to the `./deploy` directory and running:

```bash
  cd ./deploy
  kubectl delete -f .
```

This will spin down each resource defined by the .yaml files in the `deploy` directory, including the kafka component.

Once you delete all quickstart apps, delete Kafka in the cluster.

```bash
  helm uninstall dapr-kafka --namespace kafka
```

## How it Works

Now that you've run the quickstart locally and/or in Kubernetes, let's unpack how this all works. The app is broken up into input binding app and output binding app:

### Kafka Bindings yaml

Before looking at the application code, let's see the Kafka bindings component yamls([nodeapp](./nodeapp/components/kafka_bindings.yaml), [pythonapp](./pythonapp/components/kafka_bindings.yaml), and [Kubernetes](./deploy/kafka_bindings.yaml)), which specify `brokers` for Kafka connection, `topics` and `consumerGroup` for consumer, and `publishTopic` for publisher topic.

> See the howtos in [references](#references) for the details on input and output bindings


This configuration yaml creates `sample-topic` component to set up Kafka input and output bindings through the Kafka `sample` topic. 

```yaml
apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: sample-topic
spec:
  type: bindings.kafka
  metadata:
  # Kafka broker connection setting
  - name: brokers
    value: [kafka broker address]
  # consumer configuration: topic and consumer group
  - name: topics
    value: sample
  - name: consumerGroup
    value: group1
  # publisher configuration: topic
  - name: publishTopic
    value: sample
  - name: authRequired
    value: "false"
```


### Node Input binding app

Navigate to the `nodeapp` directory and open `app.js`, the code for the Node.js input bindings sample app. Here you're exposing one API endpoint using `express`. The API name must be identical to the component name which is specified in Kafka bindings component yaml. Then Dapr runtime will consume the event from `sample` topic and then send the POST request to Node app with the event payload.

```js
app.post('/sample-topic', (req, res) => {
    console.log("Hello from Kafka!");
    console.log(req.body);
    res.status(200).send();
});
```

### Python Output binding app

Navigate to the `pythonapp` directory and open `app.py`, the code for the output bindings sample app. This sends POST request to Dapr http endpoint `http://localhost:3500/v1.0/bindings/<output_bindings_name>` with the event payload every second. This app uses `sample-topic` bindings component name as `<output_bindings_name>`. Then Dapr runtime will send the event to `sample` topic which is specified in the above Kafka bindings component yaml.

```python
dapr_url = "http://localhost:{}/v1.0/bindings/sample-topic".format(dapr_port)
n = 0
while True:
    n += 1
    payload = { "data": {"orderId": n}, "operation": "create" }
    print(payload, flush=True)
    try:
        response = requests.post(dapr_url, json=payload)
        print(response.text, flush=True)

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)

    time.sleep(1)
```
