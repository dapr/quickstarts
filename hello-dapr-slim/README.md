# Hello World (Slim Init, without docker dependency)

This tutorial will demonstrate how to get Dapr running locally on your machine without docker. You will be deploying a Node.js app that subscribes to order messages demonstrating service invocation capability of Dapr. The following architecture diagram illustrates the components that make up this sample: 

![Architecture Diagram](./img/Architecture_DiagramA.png)

## Prerequisites
This sample requires you to have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js version 8 or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) [Optional]

## Step 1 - Setup Dapr (Slim Init)

Follow [instructions](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/getting-started/environment-setup.md#installing-dapr-in-self-hosted-mode) to download and install the Dapr CLI and initialize Dapr.

## Step 2 - Understand the Code

Now that Dapr has been setup locally, clone the repo, then navigate to the `11.hello-dapr-slim` sample: 

```bash
git clone [-b <dapr_version_tag>] https://github.com/dapr/samples.git
cd samples/11.hello-dapr-slim
```
> **Note**: See https://github.com/dapr/samples#supported-dapr-runtime-version for supported tags. Use `git clone https://github.com/dapr/samples.git` when using the edge version of dapr runtime.

In the `app.js` you'll find a simple `express` application, which exposes a single route and handler.

Take a look at the ```neworder``` handler:

```js
app.post('/neworder', bodyParser.json(), (req, res) => {
    const data = req.body.data;
    const orderId = data.orderId;
    console.log("Got a new order! Order ID: " + orderId);
    res.status(200).send("Got a new order! Order ID: " + orderId);
});
```

Here the endpoint `neworder`, will receive and handle messages. The handler logs the incoming message, and respond with the same log.

## Step 3 - Run the Node.js App with Dapr

1. Install dependencies: 

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    This will install `express` and `body-parser`, dependencies that are shown in `package.json`.

2. Run Node.js app with Dapr: 

    ```sh
    dapr run --app-id nodeapp --app-port 3000 --dapr-http-port 3500 node app.js
    ```

The command should output text that looks like the following, along with logs:

```
Starting Dapr with id nodeapp. HTTP Port: 3500. gRPC Port: 9165
You're up and running! Both Dapr and your app logs will appear here.
...
```
> **Note**: the `--app-port` (the port the app runs on) is configurable. The Node app happens to run on port 3000, but you could configure it to run on any other port. Also note that the Dapr `--app-port` parameter is optional, and if not supplied, a random available port is used.

## Step 4 - Post Messages to your Service

Now that Dapr and the Node.js app are running, you can POST messages against it, using different tools. **Note**: here you are POSTing against port 3500 - if you used a different port, be sure to update your URL accordingly.

First, POST the message by using Dapr cli in a new command line terminal:

Windows Command Prompt
```sh
dapr invoke --app-id nodeapp --method neworder --payload "{\"data\": { \"orderId\": \"41\" } }"
```

Windows PowerShell
```sh
dapr invoke --app-id nodeapp --method neworder --payload '{\"data\": { \"orderId\": \"41\" } }'
```

Linux or MacOS
```sh
dapr invoke --app-id nodeapp --method neworder --payload '{"data": { "orderId": "41" } }'
```

Now, you can also do this using `curl` with:

```sh
curl -XPOST -d @sample.json -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/nodeapp/method/neworder
```

Or, you can also do this using the Visual Studio Code [Rest Client Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

[sample.http](sample.http)
```http
POST http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/nodeapp/method/neworder

{
  "data": {
    "orderId": "42"
  } 
}
```

You can also use the Postman GUI.

Open Postman and create a POST request against `http://localhost:3500/v1.0/invoke/nodeapp/method/neworder`
![Postman Screenshot](./img/postman1.jpg)
In your terminal window, you should see logs indicating that the message was received and state was updated:
```bash
== APP == Got a new order! Order ID: 42
== APP == Successfully persisted state.
```

## Step 5 - Confirm Successful Service Invocation

Now, to make sure that the method definition was successfully invoked, verify that the the response is:

```
Got a new order! Order ID: 41
```

Additionally the log in the node application started with Dapr should be 

```
== APP == Got a new order! Order ID: 41
```

## Step 6 - Cleanup

To stop your service from running, simply stop the "dapr run" process. Alternatively, you can spin down your service with the Dapr CLI "stop" command. For example, to spin down the service, run this command in a new command line terminal: 

```bash
dapr stop --app-id nodeapp
```

To see that services have stopped running, run `dapr list`, noting that your services no longer appears!

## Slim Init vs Default Init

With the run of `dapr init --slim`, only the binaries `daprd` and `placement` are installed in the system. In the normal default init, `dapr init` placement service is installed as a container and additionally redis and zipkin containers are run for enabling state store and tracing, which requires Docker to be installed as a prerequisite. See [environment setup](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/getting-started/environment-setup.md) for more information. The slim init provides only limited functionaity unless you [configure](https://github.com/dapr/docs/tree/master/howto/configure-redis#Self-Hosted-Mode-without-Containers) a state store yourself.


## Next Steps

Now that you've gotten Dapr running locally on your machine, consider these next steps:
- Learn more about Dapr in the [Dapr overview](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/overview/README.md) documentation.
- Explore Dapr concepts such as building blocks and components in the [Dapr concepts](https://github.com/dapr/docs/blob/master/concepts/README.md) documentation.
