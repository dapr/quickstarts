This repository contains a series of samples that highlight Dapr capabilities. The first sample demonstrates how we run Dapr in standalone mode, while the second highlights how we run the same application in Kubernetes. Each subsequent sample includes instructions for running both in standalone and in Kubernetes.

## Supported Dapr Runtime version

Dapr is currently under community development with preview releases.  The master branch includes breaking changes, therefore ensure that you're running the samples with the right version of Dapr runtime.
